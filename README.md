TOP Library Project - Refactored

- Refactored to use JS Classes in place of standard constructors

This project is JS focused. Users can enter books to their personal library, remove them after displaying them, & toggle their read status.

Book info is entered via HTML form, which is then stored in an array as an object. These objects are then displayed as individual cards.

What I took away from this project:

- Additional pratice using HTML Forms
- Additional practice using CSS Grid
- JS Object Constructors, & Prototype Iheritance
- Learned about event.preventDefault()
